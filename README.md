Project to show a simple use of the Factory Design Pattern


### Whats is Factory ?

>In object-oriented programming, the term factory means a class that is responsible for >creating objects of other types. Typically, the class that acts as a factory has an  >object and methods associated with it. The client calls this method with certain  >parameters; objects of desired types are created in turn and returned to the client by >the factory.
>(Giridhar, Chetan - Learning Python Design Patterns)
